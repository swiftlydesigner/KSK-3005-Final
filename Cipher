        Note to coders: Only use private or mangled methods. The only public methods should be encrypt or decrypt. All methods must start with one or two underscores.
        Private method: _my_private method (starts with one _)
            - Use for methods you do not mind being seen outside of this class, but prohibit them from calling it.
        Mangled method: __my_mangled method (starts with two _)
            - Use for methods that you do not want to be visible outside of this class, ever.
